MILLIONS of cats go to shelters every year. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of those end up euthanized. We need to overcome barriers to adoption so every cat can have the home they deserve.

## Challenges
Transferring data from backend server to the frontend HTML, learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Flask.

## Accomplishments
We built a functioning web app from scratch, with little knowledge of many technologies that were necessary to succeed. 

## What's Next?
Implementing a map functionality, for users to see shelters nearby. A search function for users to search for shelters in the area. Add preferences so users can filter cats based on what they're looking for in a pet.
